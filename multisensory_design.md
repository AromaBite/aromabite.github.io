# Multisensory Design

*AromaBite* integrates multiple sensory dimensions to deliver a fully immersive eating experience. The combination of visual, haptic, and olfactory elements provides a dynamic interaction with food.

## Visual Design:
- **Shapes**: Chambers can be designed in various geometric forms to offer both aesthetic appeal and functional scent containment.
- **Color**: Edible pigments and watercolor pens can be used to create colors that influence flavor perception through visual cues.

## Haptic Design:
- **Texture and Hardness**: Textures can be adjusted from smooth to rough, while hardness is controlled by material thickness and inflation height, allowing for soft or crisp sensory experiences.

## Scent Integration:
- **Odor Selection**: Edible scents like floral, fruity, and spicy notes enhance retronasal olfactory experiences. Powdered flavorings ensure strong aromas without overpowering the natural taste.
