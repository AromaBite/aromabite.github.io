# AromaBite Design Library

The AromaBite Design Library provides a comprehensive guide to how different interactions with the AromaBite chambers map to their design features and the expected sensory experiences. This library helps creators and users understand how factors like shape, texture, scent concentration, and inflation affect the multisensory experience.
