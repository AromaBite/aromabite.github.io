## Heating Methods

In exploring the inflation properties of **_AromaBite_**, we tested several heating methods, including sealed-space techniques (oven, microwave) and unsealed-space techniques (heating table, heat gun). Each method affects the inflation, texture, and success rate of **_AromaBite_** in unique ways, with different usage considerations and benefits. By offering multiple heating methods, we expand the accessibility of **_AromaBite_** for a variety of users and application scenarios.

We observed that for larger chambers (40mm-60mm), sealed-space heating methods such as ovens and microwaves provided better inflation height and stability, with ovens being especially effective for maximizing chamber size. For smaller chambers (20mm-30mm), unsealed heating methods like the heat gun were more successful, particularly for precise, single-sided heating.

Each heating method also produces distinct textures. Sealed-space heating results in both sides of the chamber having a uniform texture, while unsealed methods lead to uneven textures, often with a noticeable difference between the two sides. For instance, the heating table tends to create rougher contact points due to the risk of burning at the heated surface.

These heating methods are versatile and can be used in various settings. Sealed-space methods are ideal for chefs or designers seeking more precise control over **_AromaBite_**'s texture and design, allowing for longer-lasting results. Unsealed-space heating, on the other hand, can be performed in front of diners, creating a dynamic and engaging dining experience.

### Heating Method Features

Different heating methods result in various textures, tastes, and characteristics. For example, ovens provide consistent, smooth, and evenly baked chambers, while microwaves heat faster but often create uneven textures. The heating table may leave burn spots, and heat guns offer rapid inflation with more variation but require careful control.

### Texture and Visual Differences

The method of heating plays a crucial role in **_AromaBite_**'s final texture. Sealed-space heating yields uniform surfaces, while unsealed methods create more variation, sometimes leading to burn spots or uneven inflation. The heating table, in particular, can cause charred contact points, while the heat gun delivers quick results but requires precise distance management to avoid uneven heating.

### Comparison of Heating Methods

| Method         | Temperature (Â°C) | Time (s)     | Rigidity                 | Texture                              | Taste         | Features                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Oven           | 230              | 45 (preheat) | Hard, Fragile             | Both sides smooth, evenly baked       | Crisp, Dry    | Requires preheating, stable results              |
| Microwave      | 110              | 15           | Soft, Less Fragile        | Both sides rough, uneven texture      | Less Crispy   | Affects inflation, sticks to plate               |
| Heating Table  | 300              | 30           | Hard, Fragile             | Rough contact points, potential burns | Crisp         | Requires continuous heat, risk of deforming      |
| Heat Gun       | 1300             | 8            | Soft, Less Fragile        | One side smooth, slight moisture      | Less Tasty    | Requires careful distance control               |

This table outlines the different heating methods, showing their temperature, time, texture, and key features, allowing users to choose the best method depending on their desired outcome.
