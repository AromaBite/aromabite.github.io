## Scented Materials

In **_AromaBite_**, we explored both natural food scents (e.g., fruits, meats, dairy, baked goods, and tea) and artificial flavorings. Scents can be classified into natural and artificial, with some acting on the olfactory system and others on the trigeminal nerve, which can trigger sensations like coolness or heat, such as mint or chili.

For our experiments, we selected four main scent types:
- Floral (osmanthus)
- Fruity (red date)
- Spice (Sichuan pepper)
- Other (coffee, mint)

Flavorings come in various forms, including powders, pastes, emulsions, and encapsulated flavors. We ultimately chose powdered flavorings using sugar as a base for their strong odor intensity, minimal impact on taste, and lack of unpleasant aftertastes. This form allowed for better odor release and an enhanced user experience.

### Expanding Odor Perception with Retronasal Olfaction

Compared to orthonasal (front) olfaction, retronasal (back) olfaction expands the potential scent palette beyond perfumes and environmental fragrances to food-related aromas. This includes rich cooking scents such as spices, oils, and herbs. Retronasal olfaction also allows the use of non-food scents, like floral or herbal notes, to create immersive dining experiences. For example, adding a subtle floral scent can evoke a garden-like atmosphere during a meal, enriching the overall experience.

### Types of Flavoring Aromas

Flavorings used in **_AromaBite_** include powdered, paste, emulsified, and encapsulated forms. These can be perceived in two ways: through interaction with the olfactory bulb for recognition of scents like flowers or spices, or through the trigeminal nerve for sensations like coolness (mint) or heat (chili).
