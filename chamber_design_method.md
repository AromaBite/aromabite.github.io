# Chamber Design Methods

*AromaBite*â€™s chamber design is the core of its functionality. These chambers are made from **Vietnamese rice paper**, a natural and edible material that becomes adhesive when moistened and expands when heated, allowing for scent storage and release.

## Key Design Parameters:
- **Material Selection**: Rice paper is flexible and becomes adhesive when moistened, ensuring the chambers can be easily sealed.
- **Chamber Shape**: Various sizes and shapes are available, from fingertip-sized to hand-sized structures, offering flexibility based on user interaction.
- **Inflation Control**: Chamber inflation height depends on the surface area and the width of the seal, ensuring the scent is released optimally during consumption.
