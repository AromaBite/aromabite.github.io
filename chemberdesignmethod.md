## Chamber Design Methods



### Material and Inflation Principles

For **_AromaBite_**, we required a sustainable, edible, and biodegradable material capable of forming airtight chambers for odor storage and release. After testing various options, Vietnamese spring roll wrappers emerged as the ideal choice. Made from tapioca starch, water, and rice paper, these wrappers become sticky when moistened and strengthen with heat, making them perfect for creating sealed, inflatable chambers.

The chamber is formed by cutting the wrapper into the desired shape, moistening the edges, and pressing them together to seal the chamber. When heated, the chamber inflates, securely trapping odors inside.

### Factors Influencing Inflation

The width of the sealed edge significantly impacts the chamberâ€™s ability to expand. A 2mm seal is effective for smaller chambers (up to 30x30 mm), allowing for better inflation. Larger chambers, however, require a 4mm seal to maintain both structural integrity and optimal inflation. Choosing the correct seal width based on chamber size is crucial for ensuring both effective sealing and inflation performance.
