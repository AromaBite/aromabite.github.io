## Workflow

To make the production of **_AromaBite_** more controlled and scalable, we designed a modular, detachable stamp tool. The stamp consists of two parts: a handle and magnetic, interchangeable molds. The molds include a blade and stamp that allow for both cutting and sealing the shape in one motion. A set of modular molds is available to create different designs.

The process for creating **_AromaBite_** chambers involves six steps:

1. **Prepare Materials:** Gather Vietnamese spring roll wrappers and assemble the stamp with the desired mold.
2. **Stamp:** Press the stamp vertically onto two layers of spring roll wrappers.
3. **Add Scent Material:** Insert the chosen edible scent.
4. **Seal:** Press the two sheets together for 1 minute to ensure a proper seal.
5. **Heat:** Select a heating method and apply heat.
6. **Inflate:** Watch as the **_AromaBite_** inflates and takes shape.

This streamlined process allows for more efficient and repeatable production.
