# Welcome to **AromaBite**

***AromaBite*** is an innovative, edible, and non-electrical odor storage and release mechanism designed to enhance flavor through dynamic retronasal olfactory experiences. 

Unlike traditional focus on smell through orthonasal olfaction, ***AromaBite*** integrates natural eating behaviors to explore the potential of retronasal olfaction in Human-Food Interaction. 

Through extensive design testing and validation, ***AromaBite*** offers a multi-sensory experience that enriches dietary interactions. Explore our Virtual Reality, Training, and Personalization demonstrations, along with design guidelines to inspire future applications.
