# Heating Methods

Heating plays a critical role in *AromaBite*’s inflation process, affecting texture and scent release. Several techniques ensure optimal inflation and sensory delivery.

## Heating Techniques:
- **Oven**: Offers consistent and stable inflation for larger chambers, providing an evenly baked texture.
- **Microwave**: Fast and effective for moderate inflation, though results may be uneven.
- **Heating Table**: Ideal for small chambers but requires careful monitoring to avoid scorching.
- **Heating Gun**: Provides rapid inflation for one-sided heating, suitable for medium to large chambers but requires precise control.
  
Each method produces unique textures, from crispy to smooth, enhancing the multisensory eating experience.
