# Fabrication Workflow

Creating *AromaBite* chambers is a simple process that allows users to customize their own designs. Below is the basic workflow for crafting your *AromaBite* chamber:

1. (a) **Prepare Materials**: Select rice paper and scented materials.
2. (b) **Stamp the Chamber**: Cut and shape the rice paper into the desired chamber form.
3. (c) **Insert Scent**: Add the chosen scented material into the chamber.
4. (d) **Seal the Chamber**: Moisten the edges to activate the adhesive properties of the rice paper.
5. (e) **Apply Heat**: Use your preferred heating method to inflate the chamber.
6. (f) **Experience**: Enjoy the flavor and aroma as the chamber releases its scent during consumption.

By following these steps, users can craft personalized *AromaBite* experiences with varied textures, scents, and shapes.
