# Scented Materials

*AromaBite* uses food-safe, commercial-grade scented materials that deliver concentrated aromas without altering the base materialâ€™s flavor. These materials are selected for their ability to maintain strong scents and provide a rich olfactory experience.

## Key Materials:
- **Powdered Flavorings**: Provide a concentrated aroma and are easy to incorporate into the rice paper chambers.
- **Natural Scents**: Ingredients like fruits, spices, and teas create natural, edible flavor experiences.
- **Artificial Scents**: Used sparingly to simulate more intense or rare aromas.
